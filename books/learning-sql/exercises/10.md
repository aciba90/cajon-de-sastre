# Chapter 10

## Exercise 10-1

Using the following table definitions and data, write a query that returns
each customer name along with their total payments:

```txt
        Customer:

Customer_id    Name
-----------    ---------------
1              John Smith
2              Kathy Jones
3              Greg Oliver

        Payment:

Payment_id    Customer_id    Amount
----------    -----------    --------
101           1              8.99
102           3              4.99
102           3              4.99
103           1              7.99
```

Include all customers, even if no payment records exist for that customer.

```sql
SELECT c.name, SUM(p.amount)
FROM customer c
LEFT OUTER JOIN payment p
ON c.customer_id = p.customer_id
GROUP BY c.customer_id
```

## Exercise 10-2

Reformulate your query from Exercise 10-1 to use the other outer join
type (e.g., if you used a left outer join in Exercise 10-1, use a right outer
join this time) such that the results are identical to Exercise 10-1.

```sql
SELECT c.name, SUM(p.amount)
FROM payment p
RIGHT OUTER JOIN customer c
ON c.customer_id = p.customer_id
GROUP BY c.customer_id
```

## Exercise 10-3 (Extra Credit)

Devise a query that will generate the set {1, 2, 3, ..., 99, 100}. (Hint: use a
cross join with at least two from clause subqueries.)

```sql
SELECT c.num + p.num FROM (
    SELECT 1 num
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 2 num
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 3 num
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 4 num
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 5 num
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 6 num
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 7 num
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 8 num
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 9 num
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 10 num
) c
CROSS JOIN (
    SELECT 0 num
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 10 num
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 20 num
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 30 num
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 40 num
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 50 num
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 60 num
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 70 num
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 80 num
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 90 num
) p
ORDER BY 1
```
