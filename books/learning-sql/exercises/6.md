## Exercise 6-1

If set A = {L M N O P} and set B = {P Q R S T}, what sets are generated
by the following operations?

1. A union B
1. A union all B
1. A intersect B
1. A except B

Solutions:

1. {L M N O P Q R S T}
1. {L M N O P P Q R S T}
1. {P}
1. {L M N O}

## Exercise 6-2

Write a compound query that finds the first and last names of all actors
and customers whose last name starts with L.

```sql
SELECT a.first_name, a.last_name
FROM actor a
WHERE last_name LIKE 'L%'
UNION ALL
SELECT c.first_name, c.last_name
FROM customer c
WHERE c.last_name LIKE 'L%';
```

## Exercise 6-3

Sort the results from Exercise 6-2 by the last_name column.

```sql
SELECT a.first_name, a.last_name
FROM actor a
WHERE last_name LIKE 'L%'
UNION ALL
SELECT c.first_name, c.last_name
FROM customer c
WHERE c.last_name LIKE 'L%'
ORDER BY last_name;
```
