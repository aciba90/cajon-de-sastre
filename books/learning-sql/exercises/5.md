```sql
SELECT c.first_name, c.last_name, a.address, ct.city
    FROM customer c
    INNER JOIN address a
    ON c.address_id = a.address_id
    INNER JOIN city ct
    ON a.city_id = ct.city_id
WHERE a.district = 'California';
```

## Exercise 5-2

Write a query that returns the title of every film in which an actor with the first name JOHN appeared.

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT f.title
FROM film f
    INNER JOIN film_actor fa
    ON f.film_id = fa.film_id
    INNER JOIN actor a
    ON fa.actor_id = a.actor_id
WHERE a.first_name = 'JOHN';
```

## Exercise 5-3

Construct a query that returns all addresses that are in the same city. You
will need to join the address table to itself, and each row should include
two different addresses.

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT a1.*
FROM address a1 
    CROSS JOIN address a2
WHERE a1.city_id = a2.city_id AND a1.address_id != a2.address_id;
```
